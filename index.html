Below is a simple HTML code for a cleaning services website homepage. I've kept it straightforward, focusing on essential elements like a header, navigation, main content section, and footer. I've also included basic inline CSS in the `<style>` tag to make it visually appealing without relying on external files. This code is responsive and can be copied directly into an HTML file.

### Explanation:
- **Header:** Contains the company name and a simple navigation menu with links to other pages (e.g., Services, About, Contact). These links are placeholders; in a real site, they'd point to actual HTML files.
- **Main Content:** Includes a hero section with a welcome message and a brief description. Below that, there's a list of services and a "Book Now" button that links to a contact page.
- **Footer:** Provides basic contact information and copyright details. It's fixed at the bottom for better visibility.
- **Styling:** Basic CSS is used to add colors, padding, and responsiveness. The design is clean and professional, aligning with a cleaning services theme.
- **Responsiveness:** The viewport meta tag ensures the page works on mobile devices.

You can save this code in a file (e.g., `index.html`) and open it in a web browser to see it in action. If you need to add more features like images or JavaScript, let me know!
